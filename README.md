## About A32

A32 is a simple 32 bit RISC instruction set targeted towards FPGA softcore implementations.

This repository contains an emulator for the A32-RP, the reference pipelined softcore implementation of A32.  
The A32 reference assembler and instruction set documentation can be found at https://github.com/Artentus/a32asm.
